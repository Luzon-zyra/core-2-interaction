                <p>"In the same way matcha tea is much more than just a drink in Japanese culture, THÉ MATCHA 26 is much more than a scent to us. It is a moment of introspection, a moment of self that offers a quiet inner celebration of grace and soulful beauty. A simple whiff takes us away from the hum of the outside and brings us back “in”.</p>

                    <p>Matcha tea accord is infused with a creamy fig note, grounded by soft vetiver and textural cedar woods, and uplifted by enticing bitter orange.</p>
                    
                    <p>Introverted and deep by nature, THÉ MATCHA 26 is a skin scent, something meant for, and only those individuals lucky enough to be very close to, the wearer. It carries a noble stillness. To us, it is a scented reminder of home, of welcomed solitude, and of all things familiar and treasured."</p>

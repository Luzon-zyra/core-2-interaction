                <p>"It was from a visit to the Château of la Malmaison that Marc-Antoine Corticchiato drew the inspiration for his EAU SUAVE. There, he found out that the Empress Josephine, a keen amateur botanist, had grown a remarkable collection of roses in her hothouses, including three varieties developed specifically for her: the Rose Joséphine, the Rose Pourpre and the Rose de Vénus.</p>

                    <p>SUAVE is a tribute to this collection, no longer extant, and to the most iconic flower of perfumery, a symbol of femininity that is also highly-prized by men in the Middle-East.</p>
                    
                    <p>Particularly incisive varieties were selected for this modern yet timeless fragrance, which reveals unusual facets of the flower. Fruity roses bring surprising peach, raspberry and apricot accents. The sensuous notes of spicy roses develop coriander, saffron and pepper facets. Finally, tea rose notes add a touch of lightness.</p>
                    
                    <p>These velvety petals rest on a chypre base: oakmoss and patchouli for their woody depth, Bourbon vanilla for its exotic touch and plush white musk for its caress…"</p>

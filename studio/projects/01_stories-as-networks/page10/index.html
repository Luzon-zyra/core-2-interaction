            <h1>And we are rapidly running out of time.

                And, yet basically nothing is happening.
                Everyone and everything needs to change so why waste precious time arguing about what and who needs to change first?
                
                Everyone and everything has to change. But the bigger your platform the bigger your responsibility.
                
                The bigger your carbon footprint the bigger your moral duty.
                When I tell politicians to act now the most common answer is that they canâ€™t do anything drastic, because that would be too unpopular among the voters.
                
                And they are right of course. Since most people are not even aware of why those changes are required. That is why I keep telling you to unite behind the science. Make the best available science the heart of politics and democracy.
                
                The EU elections are coming up soon. And many of us who will be affected the most by this crisis, people like me, are not allowed to vote. Nor are we in a position to shape the decisions of business, politics, engineering, media, education or science. Because the time it takes for us to educate ourselves to do that simply no longer exists.
                
                And that is why millions of children are taking it to the streets, school striking for the climate to create attention for the climate crisis.
                
                You need to listen to us, we who cannot vote. You need to vote for us, for your children and grandchildren.
                
                What we are doing now can soon no longer be undone.
                In this election you vote for the future living conditions of humankind.
                And though the politics needed do not exist today, some alternatives are certainly less worse than others. And I have read that some parties do not even want me standing here today because they so desperately do not want to talk about climate breakdown.

            <h1>The future — as well as all that we have achieved in the past — is literally in your hands now.
                But it’s still not too late to act.
                It will take a far-reaching vision. It will take courage. It will take a fierce determination to act now to lay the foundations where we may not know all of the details about how to shape the ceiling. In other words, it will take ‘cathedral thinking’.
                
                I ask you to please wake up and make the changes required possible.
                To do your best is no longer good enough. We must all do the seemingly impossible.
                
                And it’s okay if you refuse to listen to me. I am after all just a 16 year-old schoolgirl from Sweden.
                
                But you can not ignore the scientists, or the science. Or the millions of schoolchildren striking school for the right to a future.
                
                I beg you please do not fail, on this.

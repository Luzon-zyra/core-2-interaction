        <div class="part2">Our civilization is so       fragile. It is almost like a castle built in the sand.
            The facade is so beautiful. But the foundations are far from solid.
            We have been cutting so many corners.
            Yesterday the world watched with despair and enormous sorrow how the Notre Dame burnt in Paris.
            Some buildings are much more than just buildings.
            But the Notre Dame will be rebuilt.
            I hope that its foundations are strong.

            I hope that our foundations are even stronger. But I fear that they are not.

        1. When I was a second-grade student in China, I didn't have access to any electrical devices except for television.
        2. When my classmate invited me to hang out at her house, I had no idea what a computer or laptop was. I was so confused when she suggested joining her for a multiplayer game on this website called 7k7k (a website similar to Coolmath), as that was the first interactive game or system that I had ever experienced.
        3. I still remember how challenging it was for me to use the WASD keys to control the character, but I had a lot of fun. Since then, my classmate and I hang out more often, and we became very close friends because we played games together and were in the same class.
        4. However, this happiness didn't last long. As the first semester of my third grade was coming to a close, I received the news that I would be returning to the U.S.A, back to the place where I was born. I was sad because I would miss my friend and our gaming experiences together. 
        5. The good thing is that I can still access 7k7k here with my own laptop in the U.S.A, but unfortunately, I can no longer join my friend in games anymore.
